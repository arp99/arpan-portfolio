            <p>For the next minute, think about how you see yourself. On the whole, how much self-confidence do you have? How confident do you feel regarding your work? How about when you are with friends? Your partner if you have one? Your family? How confident do you feel when it comes to your finances? How about other things, such as making a presentation at work or talking to a stranger? Do you feel fully confident in all of the above situations? Do you feel confident regardless of the situation you are in?</p>
            <h1>What is self confidence?</h1>

            <p><strong>Self-confidence</strong> means being <strong>assured in your own worth, ability, and power,</strong> regardless of the situation you are in. Someone who is self-confident has a strong sense of self-belief and certainty in him/herself. He/she exudes calmness, composure, and is self-aware.</p>
            <p>Self-confidence is often linked with having certain knowledge, skill sets, and abilities, whether acquired or <em style="color:#057cfe;">innate</em>. While having aptitude in a particular area can help boost your self-worth, it is not a necessary prerequisite for self-confidence. Someone with absolutely no competency in something can still be confident. We will explore this in detail in the later half of the article.</p>
